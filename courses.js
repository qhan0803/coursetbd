Through investigations of organization, regulation, financing, physical delivery, and research designs, students examine the trajectory of decisions that shape and influence the accessibility, affordability, and adequacy of water and sanitation services, particularly in vulnerable neighborhoods in mostly urban and peri-urban areas.  Emphasis is placed on the importance of moving beyond the limited dimensions of supply and demand studies and gaining fluency in the multiplicative political-economic and social factors driving choices in water and sanitation systems planning.  In-depth, globally comparative readings inform the course, and expose basic services in water and sanitation as a misnomer.",

Student teams are immersed in a hands-on, lighter-than-air (LTA) vehicle design project where they design, build, and fly radio-controlled LTA vehicles. The connections between theory and practice are realized in the design exercises. Required design reviews precede the LTA race competition. The performance, weight, and principle characteristics of the LTA vehicles are estimated and illustrated using physics, mathematics, and chemistry known to freshmen, the emphasis being on the application of this knowledge to aerospace engineering and design rather than on exposure to new science and mathematics. Includes exercises in written and oral communication and team building.",

Surveys embedded microcontrollers as system elements. Laboratory sessions stress the understanding of electronic circuits at the component level, but also point out the modern approach of system integration using commercial modules and specialized integrated circuits. Enrollment may be limited due to laboratory capacity; preference to Course 2 majors and minors.",

Interactions are also described, including effects of biological scatterers on geological measurements, and effects of seafloor scattering on measurements of biological scatterers on, in, or immediately above the seafloor.  Methods of determining small-scale material properties of organisms and the seafloor are outlined. Operational methods are emphasized, and corresponding measurement theory is described.

Students complete a 10-12 week internship, which includes filing three progress reports, conducting one informational interview, and possibly hosting a site visit by MIT staff.  Returning to campus as juniors, UPOP students take part in reflective exercises that aid assimilation of learning objectives and reinforce the cognitive link between all aspects of the UPOP experience and disciplinary fields of study.

Bridges the disease modeling efforts at the large-scale population-level and those at the micro-scale pathogen-level via the use of fluid dynamics. Covers topics such as interfacial flows, fluid fragmentation, multiphase flows, turbulent flows, and fluid-structure interaction. Intended for students with a strong quantitative background interested in learning about applications in health and epidemiology and for students with an epidemiology and health background interested in learning about fluid dynamics approaches relevant to disease transmission. In the spirit of the OneHealth Initiative, covers advanced topics on the health of human, animal, and plant populations.",

Students will trace the evolution of amphibious warfare through analysis of case studies using amphibious and maneuver doctrine as a framework.  By the end of this course, students will comprehend modern employment concepts and challenges relating to the use of amphibious forces.",

Students meet in study groups of five to six participants with facilitators trained in effective classroom techniques and concept focus. The study groups help students to reinforce concepts learned in the regular curriculum, and help them to gain mastery of concepts and problems that are often more challenging than those dealt with during lecture. The small study group format emphasizes the full participation of each student with the facilitator acting as a guide. The regularity of weekly meetings enhances the students' understanding of MIT's academic expectations. After the initial meetings, students are encouraged to take more responsibility and to lead the group in problem-solving sessions, which helps to maximize their own learning. Each study group meets for a minimum of three hours each week. The meeting time is set by the XL facilitator based on students' schedules.",

Feminist research involves rethinking disciplinary assumptions and methodologies, developing new understandings of what counts as knowledge, seeking alternative ways of understanding the origins of problems/issues, formulating new ways of asking questions and redefining the relationship between subjects and objects of study. Focus on methodology, i.e., the theory and analysis of how research should proceed. Special attention to epistemological issues--pre-suppositions about the nature of knowledge. What makes research distinctively feminist lies in the complex connections between epistemologies, methodologies and research methods. Explore how these connections are formed in the traditional disciplines and raise questions about why they are inadequate and/or problematic for feminist inquiry and what, specifically, are the feminist critiques of these intersections.",
